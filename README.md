**CareBridge** is a full‑stack telehealth platform that connects **doctors** and **patients**.  It provides features such as appointment scheduling, electronic health records (EHR), prescriptions, secure file upload, messaging, and real‑time video consultations.  The project is divided into a **backend** service written in Node.js/Express with MongoDB and a **frontend** consisting of two React applications (Doctor and Patient) built with Vite and TypeScript.  Video meetings are powered by VideoSDK.

## Features

### Core functionality

- **User authentication & authorisation** – secure sign‑in and registration endpoints using JWT tokens (handled in the backend).
- **Role‑based interfaces** – separate React applications for doctors and patients with tailored navigation and pages.
- **Appointment management** – doctors can schedule, edit and view appointments; patients can request and see upcoming appointments.  Appointment routes are registered in the backend (`/api/appointments`).
- **Real‑time video calls** – VideoSDK is used to create rooms and tokens for doctor–patient video consultations.  The backend exposes a meeting controller that generates a VideoSDK token and creates a room using the VideoSDK API; the doctor and patient UIs use `@videosdk.live/react‑sdk` for the front‑end experience.
- **Secure messaging & socket support** – Socket.IO is configured on the server for real‑time features such as chat and live status updates.  Client‑side pages include messaging modules.
- **Electronic health records** – doctors can view and update patient health records, and patients can view their EHR (handled under `/api/health‑records` routes).
- **Intake & medical forms** – patients can submit intake forms; doctors can review them.
- **Prescriptions** – doctors can create and manage prescriptions for patients; patients can view their prescriptions.
- **File uploads** – files such as medical documents and prescriptions can be uploaded and stored (AWS S3 client is included in the doctor app dependencies).
- **Dashboards** – both doctor and patient apps include dashboards with overviews (appointments, messages, records etc.).
- **Charts & analytics** – the patient app uses Recharts for interactive charts.

## Tech stack

### Backend

- **Node.js & Express.js** – REST API server for authentication, appointments, health records, prescriptions, meetings and other endpoints.
- **MongoDB (Mongoose)** – primary database for users, appointments, meetings and EHRs, with a default connection to a `carebridge-md` database.
- **Socket.IO** – WebSocket server for real‑time features such as chat and live updates.
- **VideoSDK token generation** – tokens are generated using a JWT secret and VideoSDK API key.
- **Other libraries** – Nodemailer (email), Multer (file uploads), BcryptJS (password hashing), Axios (HTTP requests to VideoSDK), Jest (testing) and more.

### Frontend

- **React with TypeScript** – two Vite‑based apps (`Doctor` and `Patient`).
- **Tailwind CSS** – utility‑first styling and responsive design.
- **TanStack React‑Query** – data fetching and caching.
- **VideoSDK React SDK** – components for video calls.
- **Formik & Yup** – form management and validation.
- **React Router DOM** – client‑side routing.
- **Other tools** – AWS SDK (S3) for storage, Lucide React icons, React Player for video playback, Recharts for charts in the patient app.

```

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v18+ recommended) and **npm**.
- **MongoDB** running locally or accessible via URI.
- VideoSDK API credentials (API key and secret) for generating meeting tokens.
- (Optional) AWS S3 credentials if you intend to enable file uploads.

### Backend setup

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DhRuva-1509/CareBridge.git
   cd CareBridge/backend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Create an `.env` file** (use `.env.example` as a reference if present) and set the following variables:

   ```bash
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/carebridge-md
   PORT=3000
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
   VIDEOSDK_API_KEY=your_videosdk_api_key
   VIDEOSDK_SECRET_KEY=your_videosdk_secret
   ```

4. **Run the development server**:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The API will start on the configured `PORT` (default 3000) and will automatically connect to MongoDB and initialise Socket.IO.

### Frontend setup (Doctor & Patient)

The doctor and patient applications are separate; you can run one or both depending on your role.

1. **Doctor app**:

   ```bash
   cd CareBridge/frontend/Doctor
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

   The doctor dashboard will start at `http://localhost:5173` (or another Vite‑assigned port).  Set up a `.env` file if the app uses environment variables (e.g., `VITE_API_URL` for backend base URL).

2. **Patient app**:

   ```bash
   cd CareBridge/frontend/Patient
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

   The patient portal will start at `http://localhost:5174` (or another Vite port).  Similarly, create a `.env` file to configure API endpoints.

3. **Shared modules**: if you modify the `shared-modules` package, rebuild or reinstall it in both apps.

### Building for production

For each application (backend, Doctor, Patient), run the appropriate build script:

```bash
# Backend build (compiles TypeScript)
cd backend && npm run build

# Doctor app build
cd frontend/Doctor && npm run build

# Patient app build
cd frontend/Patient && npm run build
```

Built front‑end assets can then be served via a static hosting service or integrated with the backend.
